## Experiment I:

Train quantifiers on three small 2-dimensional data manifolds. Observe their
vector fields and quantifier heatmaps.

### TODO:

- Move 'plot_curves' and 'make_loaders' from helper.py to emma/
- Create different generic noise processes
- Add the noise processes in the inference step 'train' in main.py
- Move 'train' to emma/
- Add early stopping
