## Experiment II:

Train quantifier on a particular class and then compare the quantifier values
on the seen and unseen classes. Two different experiments are made:
- Checking how the quantifier value observes on increasingly noisy values 
(expected: the more noisy, the higher the quantifier value)
- Comparing the quantifier on the seen and unseen class (expected: higher engery
on the unseen class)
