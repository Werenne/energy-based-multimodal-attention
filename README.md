### TODO: 
* Visual Model
    * Beam search and co for fixing of Model
    * Curriculum Learning
    * Externatl Language Model
    * Knowledge distillation? - some paper said it was better with transformer
    * Label Smoothing
    * Scheduled sampling
* Audio Model
    * Audio databuilder
    * Evaluate alone
* Audio-visual Model
    * Fusion
    * Evaluate: with and without noise (quick test)
* Simul Embedded System
    * Missing frames
    * Noise for audio and light interference for video
    * Activation Maps
    * Bayesian Approx -> Dropout
    * Dual Modes
    * Evaluate - [Interpret](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations) - Robustness analysis
* Cool visualizations [Loss function](https://github.com/tomgoldstein/loss-landscape)
* Fast decoding
    * Ideas

* Slides results
* Theoretic framework


(do as much as possible in ugly mode but with results, then refactor)
