\section{Experiment II}\label{sec:setup-expII}
Each autoencoder was constructed as in \ref{sec:overcomplete}, with $L=4$ and 12 hidden units. The training details are listed below
\begin{itemize}
\item number of epochs: 30
\item batch size: 64
\item $\sigma$ noise denoising: 0.01 (to not be confused with corruption process to simulate noisy modes)
\item Adam optimizer, with learning rate: 0.001
\end{itemize}
